Setup and Build the Template
============================

This is fairly easy. First, clone the project template repository and step
into the dir, as follows (you've probably done it already if you read this
file).

$ hg clone http://lemon.cs.elte.hu/hg/lemon-project-template myproject
$ cd myproject

As you probably want to use LEMON in your project, you will need it
too. For this you have to options. You can either install it somewhere
or use a local copy of LEMON dedicated to your project. This later
option is especially usefull if you also modify/develop LEMON along
with your project, or want to use a specific version.

Use a preinstalled version.

    See http://lemon.cs.elte.hu/trac/lemon/wiki/InstallGuide for
    instructions on how to install LEMON. If you installed it to a
    non-standard place, you must let CMAKE know where to find it in
    the LEMON_ROOT_DIR config variable.


HTSLIB_ROOT_DIR

Use LEMON as a subproject.

    Just simply copying the LEMON source code into the 'lemon' subdir
    will do the job. Namely, you can either extract a release tarball

    $ wget http://lemon.cs.elte.hu/pub/sources/lemon-1.1.tar.gz
    $ tar xzf lemon-1.1.tar.gz
    $ mv lemon-1.1 lemon

    or - even better - you can check out the mercurial LEMON repository

    $ hg clone http://lemon.cs.elte.hu/hg/lemon-main lemon

Then run CMAKE to create the makefiles as usual.

$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake-gui ..


Setup Your Own Project
======================

Edit CMakeLists.txt to change the name of the project and the source
files. Simply follow the instructions in CMakeLists.txt.
